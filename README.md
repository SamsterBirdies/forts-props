# forts-props
Adds a lot of props to forts

Place the props folder in the folder of your map.
Delete unused assets.
You can delete animated assets by deleting a folder in props/animated and then commenting out the dofile for that folder in props/animated/sprites.lua

You may use this mod for anything involving Forts mapping and modding for the Forts Steam Workshop.
